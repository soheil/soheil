### Hi there 👋

I used to have another Github profile, but I lost my 2fa on my phone and access to that account so had to create a new one. GitHub gave me my old username (@soheil), but did transfer my original repos and their stars. ✨

Here you can find much of the work I do in my free time. Outside of GitHub, I am a fan of rail travel, and aspiring advocate of clean technology and efficient infrastructure and living.

* 🛠️ I'm comfortable working with Docker, GitHub Workflows, Deno, Vue/Nuxt, PlatformIO, C, C++, VHDL, Python, and in both backend and frontend development
* 🚧 Projects I would like to spend more time on:
  * [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT), an open-source attempt to make GPT-4 autonomous.

### Some quick stats
